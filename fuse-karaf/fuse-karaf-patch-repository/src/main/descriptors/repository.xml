            This is the main file set for Fuse Karaf patches - a set that creates Maven repository structure.
            We always have transitive dependencies in target/patch-repository, but this means we may get some apache
            or jboss-parent poms we don't need.
            Remember - this file set impacts the content of actual Fuse patch and it's important to manage the content
            properly.

            Second set adds just one file which should be maintained separately and should be the patch descriptor
            for Fuse Karaf patching mechanism.
            Maybe there's a way to generate it, but for Fuse Karaf hotfix patches we have to write it manually for now.
