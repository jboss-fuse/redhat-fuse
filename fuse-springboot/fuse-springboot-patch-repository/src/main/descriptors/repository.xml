            There is only one file set for Fuse Spring Boot patches - a set that creates Maven repository structure.
            We always have transitive dependencies in target/patch-repository, but this means we may get some apache
            or jboss-parent poms we don't need.
            Remember - this file set impacts the content of actual Fuse patch and it's important to manage the content
            properly.
